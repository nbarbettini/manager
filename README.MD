# Hi, I'm Nate

## My role

## Communication and scheduling

* Async if it's not time critical, meeting on the calendar if it is
* Slack over email, I'm not ignoring you

## Giving feedback

* Receiving: "Hey, I have a suggestion" or "Can I share some feedback?" - go to Rob or someone else higher up if uncomfortable

* Giving: I will do the same

## Working hours

I'm an early riser and prefer to be working by 7:00 or 8:00 (PST). I use the few hours before everyone gets to the office for focused work that is impossible once meetings start. I try to wrap up by 17:00 or 17:30.

If you see emails or replies from me super early in the morning, or at other weird times, don't worry! I'm not expecting you to be working. Everyone has their own schedule that works for them.

## Outside of work

## Et cetera

Thanks to Molly White for an [excellent example of a manager readme](https://github.com/molly/manager-README), which I've borrowed from here.
